# AI driven WordPress Blog Design

Prototyping ideas for and AI driven WordPress front-end blog design tool.  This is a learning experiment done Bolt.new

My ultimate goal is to create an AI tool that will 
* Take a user's wordpress.com blog url
* Take a user's blog design description
* Translate natural langage description into a great blog design
* Show the user a preview of the design with their blog content


The state of the prototype as of now doesn't include AI, rather just has present designs.

## ðŸš§ Current Status 
This is an early-stage prototype focused on functinality concepts and using Bolt. The current version does not yet include AI features.  But it does have a flow working that ends in preview of the user's blog content in a new design.
